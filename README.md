I fell in love with coding when I first took an R class in college. Since then I've learned that I love creating interfaces that help people accompslish things more effectively. 

I'm looking for a job in backend web development, ideally writting Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, please reach out!
